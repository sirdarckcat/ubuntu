 * The main surface is Y-tiled and is at plane index 0 whereas CCS is linear

 * be ignored. The clear color structure is 256 bits. The first 128 bits
 * represents Raw Clear Color Red, Green, Blue and Alpha color each represented
 * by 32 bits. The raw clear color is consumed by the 3d engine and generates
 * the converted clear color of size 64 bits. The first 32 bits store the Lower
 * Converted Clear Color value and the next 32 bits store the Higher Converted
 * Clear Color value when applicable. The Converted Clear Color values are
 * consumed by the DE. The last 64 bits are used to store Color Discard Enable
 * and Depth Clear Value Valid which are ignored by the DE. A CCS cache line
 * corresponds to an area of 4x1 tiles in the main surface. The main surface
 * pitch is required to be a multiple of 4 tile widths.
