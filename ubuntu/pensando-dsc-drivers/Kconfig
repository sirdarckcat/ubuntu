	help
	  Pensando specific platform driver for Userspace I/O devices,
	  including generic interrupt handling code. Shared interrupts
	  are not supported.

	  This kernel driver requires that the matching userspace driver
	  handles interrupts in a special way. Userspace is responsible
	  for acknowledging the hardware device if needed, and re-enabling
	  interrupts in the interrupt controller using the write() syscall.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

	help
	  This driver module is a companion to the kpcimgr driver.  This module
	  provides support for servicing the pcie bus hardware "indirect" and
	  "notify" transaction interrupts.  This driver runs on the Pensando ARM cpu.

	  The core of the driver is built using sources from the pciesvc library
	  with only a thin wrapper of code here to package the pciesvc core
	  and register with the kpcimgr driver by calling "kpcimgr_module_register".
