description: |
  QSEECOM provides an interface to Qualcomm's Secure Execution Environment
  (SEE) running in the Trust Zone via SCM calls. In particular, it allows
  communication with secure applications running therein.

  Applications running in this environment can, for example, include
  'uefisecapp', which is required for accessing UEFI variables on certain
  systems as these cannot be accessed directly.
