menuconfig MELLANOX_PLATFORM
	bool "Platform support for Mellanox hardware"
	depends on X86 || ARM || ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST
	---help---
	  Say Y here to get to see options for platform support for
	  Mellanox systems. This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled.

config MLXREG_HOTPLUG
	tristate "Mellanox platform hotplug driver support"
	depends on REGMAP
	depends on HWMON
	depends on I2C
	---help---
	  This driver handles hot-plug events for the power suppliers, power
	  cables and fans on the wide range Mellanox IB and Ethernet systems.

config MLXREG_IO
	tristate "Mellanox platform register access driver support"
	depends on REGMAP
	depends on HWMON
	help
	  This driver allows access to Mellanox programmable device register
	  space through sysfs interface. The sets of registers for sysfs access
	  are defined per system type bases and include the registers related
	  to system resets operation, system reset causes monitoring and some
	  kinds of mux selection.

config MLXBF_TMFIFO
	tristate "Mellanox BlueField SoC TmFifo platform driver"
	depends on ARM64
	depends on ACPI
	depends on VIRTIO_CONSOLE && VIRTIO_NET
	help
	  Say y here to enable TmFifo support. The TmFifo driver provides
          platform driver support for the TmFifo which supports console
          and networking based on the virtio framework.

config MLXBF_TRIO
        tristate "Mellanox TRIO driver"
        depends on ARM64
        help
          This driver supports the TRIO PCIe root complex interface on
          Mellanox BlueField SoCs.

config MLXBF_PMC
       tristate "Mellanox BlueField performance counter driver"
       depends on ARM64 && HWMON
       help
         This driver supports the performance counters of Mellanox
         Bluefield SoC.

config MLXBF_BOOTCTL
	tristate "Mellanox BlueField Firmware Boot Control driver"
	depends on ARM64
	depends on ACPI
	help
          The Mellanox BlueField firmware implements functionality to
          request swapping the primary and alternate eMMC boot partition,
          and to set up a watchdog that can undo that swap if the system
          does not boot up correctly. This driver provides sysfs access
          to the userspace tools, to be used in conjunction with the eMMC
          device driver to do necessary initial swap of the boot partition.

config MLXBF_LIVEFISH
        tristate "Mellanox BlueField livefish firmware update driver"
        depends on ARM64
        help
          If you say yes to this option, support will added for the
          mlxbf-livefish driver.  This driver allows MFT tools to
          update ConnectX HCA firmware on a Mellanox BlueField SoC
          when it is in livefish mode.
